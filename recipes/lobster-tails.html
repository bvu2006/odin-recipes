  <h1>The Best Grilled Lobster Tails</h1>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Grilled lobster tails are the ultimate summer extravagance, so you'll 
    want to make sure to treat them right. This method assures tender and 
    juicy lobster meat cradled in a shell brimming with garlicky, herby 
    butter. We start with frozen tails because that's what's most reliably 
    available, but if you have access to fresh, by all means use them.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive oil, for brushing</li>
      <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, very finely chopped or grated</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Four 8-ounce frozen lobster tails, thawed</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Special equipment:</h4>
    8 wooden or metal skewers, at least 12 inches long
    <ol>
      <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before grilling.</li>
      <li>Prepare a grill for medium-high heat and brush the grill grates with oil.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic 
        and cook until sizzling, about 30 seconds. Remove and stir in the lemon zest 
        and juice. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes, then stir in the parsley, 
        chives and cayenne. Keep warm.</li>
      <li>Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut lengthwise through the top of the 
        lobster shells, then pull the shells apart slightly to expose the lobster 
        meat. Use a knife to cut almost but not completely through the tails and 
        push the cut sides open slightly. Insert a skewer lengthwise through each 
        side of the tails to keep them from curling during grilling. Brush all 
        over with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt.</li>
      <li>Grill the tails meat-side down until the shells begin to turn red all over, 
        4 to 5 minutes. Flip, then brush the meat generously with the butter. Cover 
        with the lid and grill until the meat has just turned white, about 3 minutes. 
        Flip once more, brush again with the butter and grill until the shells are 
        bright red and the meat is just cooked through, about 1 minute more.</li>
      <li>Remove the skewers and serve with any extra warm butter on the side.</li>
    </ol>
